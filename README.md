VIAT Corpus Builder
=============

Create the VIAT test corpus with the help of some Shell-Scripts and Matlab files. Telephone Spam files are also included.

Loads 16Bit 8kHz PCM wave data, modifies and writes to given output directory.
Other samplerates should be possible but needs some changes in the scripts

Be sure to have sox and ffmpeg installed for GSM and G726
   
known issues:
- noise is not computed on the fly! could be
  detected by highly sensitive matching algorithm
- do not use spaces in file path
